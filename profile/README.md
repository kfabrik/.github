# KFabrik

**KFabrik** is a developer and CI tool for building reliable, reproducible CNCF Cloud-Native AI (CNAI) stacks.

## What we do
- Spin up local CNAI stacks for development and testing (Kubernetes, KServe, Ray, vLLM, vector DBs)
- Integrate CNAI environments into CI/CD pipelines
- Deterministic, reproducible builds for testing and validation
- Opinionated defaults, boring reliability

## Principles
- CNCF-native
- Secure by default
- Declarative and reproducible
- No magic, no lock-in
